## Instructions

1. **Classify the request**: Read the user's request and match it against the routing table above. Look for keyword matches and semantic intent, not just exact phrases.

2. **If the intent is clear** (maps to exactly one command):
   - State which command you're routing to and why, in one short line (e.g., "Routing to `/fund-metrics` — you're asking for IRR computation.")
   - Execute that command's full workflow immediately, passing the relevant portion of the request as the argument. Follow the target command's instructions exactly as if the user had invoked it directly.

3. **If the intent is ambiguous** (could map to multiple commands):
   - State which commands matched and why (e.g., "This matches `/lp-report` and `/status` — running both.")
   - Execute all matching commands sequentially, passing the user's request to each one.
   - Clearly separate the output of each command with a heading so the user can distinguish results.

4. **If the request doesn't match any command**:
   - Tell the user their request doesn't map to a known workflow.
   - List the available commands with one-line descriptions so they can choose or rephrase:
     **PE/VC Commands:**
     - `/research` — Deep-dive analysis on a PE/VC topic
     - `/fund-metrics` — Compute IRR, TVPI, DPI, and other fund metrics
     - `/lp-report` — Generate an ILPA-compliant LP report
     - `/portfolio-review` — Full portfolio snapshot with company detail

     - `/benchmark` — Peer benchmarking and quartile analysis
     - `/data-room` — Parse and index a data room
     - `/example` — Demo the plugin with fabricated data
     - `/status` — Show research progress and data gaps

     - `/rent-roll` — Rent roll: snapshot of all contracted income
     - `/lease-expiration` — Lease expiration schedule and rollover risk
     - `/lease-abstracting` — Lease abstract: key clauses and terms summary

     - `/cre-valuation` — Property valuation (cap rate, DCF, comps, NAV)

     - `/sensitivity-analysis` — Sensitivity and stress-test analysis

## Workspace Rules (MANDATORY)

Before executing any command, follow these rules:

1. **All files go in `output/`.** Run `mkdir -p output _research` first. Save every deliverable (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, CSV, MD) to the `output/` subdirectory — e.g. `output/report.pdf`. The runtime ONLY collects files from `output/` — files written anywhere else will NOT be returned to the user.
2. **Use relative paths only.** Never write to `/home/user/`, `/home/agent/`, `/tmp/`, or any absolute path outside cwd.
3. **Don't waste turns on setup.** Do not check `$HOME`, do not explore the filesystem. Start working immediately.

## Design System (MANDATORY for file output)

When the routed command produces a file deliverable, read these design references BEFORE generating:

1. `/shared/plugins/nestbox-df1ef9f0/skills/design-system/references/tokens.md` — colors, typography, number formatting
2. `/shared/plugins/nestbox-df1ef9f0/skills/design-system/references/components.md` — title page, table, KPI card, chart patterns
3. `/shared/plugins/nestbox-df1ef9f0/skills/design-system/references/language.md` — PE/VC terminology, tone, disclaimers
4. `/shared/plugins/nestbox-df1ef9f0/brand/assets/brand-overrides.json` — firm name, confidentiality notice
5. Copy logo into workspace: `cp /shared/plugins/nestbox-df1ef9f0/brand/assets/logo.png ./logo.png 2>/dev/null || true`

## Critical Rules

- Always route — never answer the question yourself. The specialized commands have the domain logic.
- When the intent is clear, proceed immediately without asking for confirmation.
- When ambiguous, run all matching commands — don't ask, don't guess, just run them all.
- Pass the user's original request context through to the target command so nothing is lost.
